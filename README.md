# Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition and Location Verification

## 📌 Overview
A web-based Smart Attendance System that uses Face Recognition and Location Verification to securely mark student attendance.  
The system ensures that attendance is recorded only when the student is physically present in the classroom, preventing proxy attendance.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Traditional attendance systems in universities rely on manual methods or simple digital entry, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and vulnerable to proxy attendance.  
Students can mark attendance without being physically present, reducing discipline and learning effectiveness.  
There is a need for a secure, automated, and reliable attendance system that ensures the physical presence of students while minimizing manual effort for faculty.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Eliminate proxy attendance in classrooms  
- Automate the attendance marking process  
- Verify student identity using face recognition  
- Ensure classroom presence using real-time location verification  
- Provide an easy-to-use web system for students and teachers  
- Reduce manual work and errors in attendance management

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The system uses Face Recognition through the device camera and verifies student location within a predefined classroom radius before marking attendance.  
Teachers can manage classes, view attendance records, and export reports.  
This approach ensures high accuracy, prevents proxy attendance, and improves efficiency in university attendance management.
